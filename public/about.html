<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, My name is Sajad Ali Tavakoli, and I am a 24-year-old software engineering.</p>

<p>I graduated from Abdulrahim Shaheed High School in 1396, where I developed a strong foundation in mathematics and the sciences. My passion for technology led me to pursue a degree in Software Engineering at the Faculty of Computer Science at Avicenna University, from which I graduated in 1401. During my studies, I honed my skills in various programming languages, software development methodologies, problem-solving techniques and mathematics.  Throughout my academic career, I was involved in several projects that allowed me to apply my knowledge practically. These experiences not only enhanced my technical abilities but also taught me the importance of teamwork, communication, and continuous learning.</p>

<p>One of my greatest strengths is my ability to solve complex problems. I approach challenges with a strategic mindset, breaking down issues into manageable parts and finding creative solutions. My experience in teaching has further enhanced my problem-solving skills, as I have learned how to explain complex concepts in a clear and understandable manner.</p>
